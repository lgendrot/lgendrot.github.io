Hi there! I'm Luc, and this is my blog. Viewer beware.

I have a degree in biology, I'm passionate about data science, and I fancy myself an autodidact. I really love NLP and Machine Learning and most of my personal projects reflect that. Occasionally I write about whatever it is I'm working on and only slightly more frequently I write about what's going on in the world.

I'm also a huge fantasy nerd, lover of books, and an expert at bingeing on TV. My current obsession is "The Magicians" TV show based on the Lev Grossman series by the same name. Feel free to geek out with me unsolicited.

If you do want to geek out with me, or contact me for a more normal reason, your best bet is to hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/lgendrot), or failing that email me: lgendrot -at- gmail.
