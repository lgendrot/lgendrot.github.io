<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Inspiration</h2>
<p>Reddit user <a href="http://reddit.com/u/Insanimate" target="_blank">/u/Insanimate</a> made this hotsauce packet painting and posted it on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pics" target="_blank">/r/pics</a>. The president of TacoBell-or whoever runs their social media accounts-then showed up in the post and asked how they could buy one.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-215" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-26-at-3.32.42-PM-e1443306853325.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-26 at 3.32.42 PM" width="749" height="386" /></p>
<p>Nobody noticed. The painting was posted over a year ago, yet the president's comment went unrecognized and unseen at only 13 points before it wound up on /r/bestof last week.</p>
<p>This is a scenario I've seen play out all over reddit whenever a 'celebrity' reddit user makes a comment. Nobody knows, or is skeptical about the veracity of a user's identity.</p>
<p>So to help ameliorate this problem I made a reddit bot that searches through a user's history, and returns a table of the user's AMA posts. If there are no such posts, then nothing happens.</p>

<p>The code above is commented, so I won't go through it line by line, but in broad strokes:</p>
<p>1) The script grabs all the most recent comments in a subreddit, and checks to see if they begin with "!identify", which I have chosen as my "summoning" phrase.</p>
<p>2) The script checks a MongoDB database to see whether or not we've handled this comment before. If not, it continues.</p>
<p>3) Then, if the comment starts with "!identify" the script will either: Use the parent comment's author and will check for their AMAs, or if a user is specified, then it will check for their AMAs</p>
<p>4) If any AMAs are found some sparse information is saved about them (Permalink, title, number of comments) and is formatted into a reddit table.</p>
<p>5) The bot comments, adds the summoning comment IDs to the Mongo database, and sleeps for 5 minutes (or however long you want).</p>
<p>The output looks a little something like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-227" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-26-at-4.12.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-26 at 4.12.42 PM" width="644" height="202" /></p>
<p>The code is pretty ugly, but it works okay from what I've seen and I did this on a lark, so I'm not terribly concerned. Now I have to figure out how to spread the word about the summoning phrase, so I can set it loose in the wild and see if people actually find it useful and so I can improve it if need be.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Next Steps</h2>
<p>1) Set this up to run continuously on an unused computer in my house, because I'm too cheap and lazy to find and set up a host online.</p>
<p>2) Make it so it deletes comments with -1 comment karma, so the reddit hivemind won't get angry.</p>
<p>3) Make more reddit bots because this was fun.</p>
