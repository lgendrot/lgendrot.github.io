      <div id="aboutme-text">
        <p> Hi there! I'm Luc. I'm a programmer, machine learning nerd, and a big fan of puns. 
        I have a degree in biology, but--like seemingly everyone my age with a college education--I don't really work in my original field 
        of study.</p>

        <p> I'm currently a freelance data scientist and python developer.
        At any given moment I can be found collecting (and sometimes even reading) O'Reilly programming textbooks, cleaning data, 
        training machine learning models, writing visualization code, or trying to figure out how twitter works.</p>

        <p>I fancy myself an autodidact, which is just a pretentious way of saying I'm a self taught programmer and I don't shy away from working
        on things I don't already understand. In my (admittedly humble) opinion, being an expert doesn't always mean you know everything, 
        it just means you know how to learn anything.</p>
        
        <p>If you'd like to yell at me about my opinions and why they're wrong, or if you'd like to hire me for a project (or both!) 
        please feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/lgendrot">Twitter.</a></p>

      <div class="job-title"><h2>RankSense</h2> <span class="duration"> October 2017 - May 2018</span></div>
      <div class="job-description">
        <p><a href="https://www.ranksense.com">RankSense</a> is an SEO company specializing in data driven insights. RankSense's software
          allows us to dynamically change SEO related page content (such as meta descriptions and title tags). Over dozens of past clients and
          millions of lines of data, we use machine learning to determine the best changes to make so your site gets more traffic faster.
        </p>

        <p>At RankSense I was responsible for a myriad of data science and general development tasks, 
          from A/B testing, to developing flask APIs, to training convolutional neural nets and visualizing results. 
          Most of my work was done in Python, but R was also used occasionally for proof of concept work.</p>
